_Coquillettidia perturbans_ is the most well-known _Coquillettidia_ species and can be found near lakes and ponds where aquatic plants, such as cattails, are present. Their larvae live below the surface of the water and water temperature determines their final stages in spring metamorphosis. In BC there is only one generation of _Coquillettidia perturbans_ per year and the adult population was most abundant around the second to third week of July.
