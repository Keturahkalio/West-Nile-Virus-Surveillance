_Aedes_ species are typically the most abundant mosquitoes in Canada and are numerous in BC. _Aedes_ were the most collected mosquitoes in all years of the active mosquito surveillance program that ran from 2003 to 2014. These mosquitoes have a reputation as nuisance pests, especially when flooding occurs, and the amount collected from year to year varied depending on the amount of moisture accumulation and snowmelt. There are both endemic and invasive _Aedes_ species in British Columbia. In 2014 the invasive species _Aedes japonicus_ was first detected in British Columbia.
