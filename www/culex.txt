_Culex_ species are more often found infected with WNV than any other group of mosquitoes across the North American continent, and the two primary vector species that drive WNV activity in BC are _Culex pipiens_ and _Culex tarsalis_.  WNV has been detected in eleven _Culex tarsalis_ mosquito pools in the South Okanagan, with the first detection occurring in 2009.
