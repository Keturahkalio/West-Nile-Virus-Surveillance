**Locally acquired:** A case who likely acquired their infection inside of British Columbia based on a review of available exposure history in addition to clinical and laboratory evidence. Cases that acquired their infection within the province of British Columbia but away from their place of residence (i.e. through travel within British Columbia) are considered to be locally acquired for the purposes of surveillance and reporting. Cases in horses are classified as locally acquired if the horse did not travel off of their resident farm during the incubation period.

**Travel-related:** A case who likely acquired their infection during travel outside of British Columbia based on a review of available exposure history in addition to clinical and laboratory evidence. Cases in horses are classified as travel-related if the horse left their resident farm during the incubation period.
