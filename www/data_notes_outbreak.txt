Since the establishment of a provincial WNV surveillance system in 2002, a wide variety of partners have supported surveillance in BC including the BCCDC, BC Ministry of Agriculture and Food's Animal Health Centre (AHC), the Office of the Provincial Health Officer (OPHO), the Regional Health Authorities (RHAs), individual physicians, veterinarians, municipal governments, mosquito control contractors, bird banders, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Canadian Blood Services (CBS), BC Transplant, and the Public Health Agency of Canada.

**Surveillance of WNV in Humans**

In accordance with established reporting practices for reportable communicable diseases in humans, a laboratory notification is communicated to the requesting physician as well as to the appropriate Regional Health Authority for case follow-up to collect information regarding clinical presentation and exposure history using a standardized case report form. Cases are classified as West Nile non-Neurological Syndrome (WN-non-NS), West Nile Neurological Syndrome (WNNS), or West Nile Asymptomatic Syndrome (WNAI) according to both self-reported symptoms and clinical information collected from the patient’s physician. Cases are further categorized as probable or confirmed depending on clinical and laboratory evidence. Case geography for locally acquired cases is based on the location of residence, which may not reflect the location of disease acquisition.

**Surveillance of WNV in Horses**

Passive surveillance of WNV infection in horses was incorporated into the provincial WNV surveillance system in 2009. Specimens from horses suspected of being infected with the virus are collected by the attending veterinarians and submitted for WNV testing at the AHC. Horses that die or are euthanized after exhibiting neurological symptoms and are submitted for diagnostic necropsy may also be tested for WNV. All cases of equine WNv infection are reportable to the BCCDC as per provincial legislation and regulation. 

**Surveillance of WNV in Corvids**

Corvid surveillance was initially a key component of WNV surveillance in BC and was actively conducted from 2002 - 2015. The RHAs were responsible for the collection and submission of dead corvids to the AHC where testing was completed (VecTest® disptick test from 2002-2010, replaced by polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing from 2011 onwards). To acquire samples of deceased corvids RHAs worked with municipal governments, who coordinated with parks workers, the public, and even the BC SPCA, to locate and collect samples. From 2004 to 2015, the BCCDC also hosted an online reporting portal where members of the public could report sightings of dead corvids though BC's wild bird mortality line where staff/contractors would be dispatched to collect and submit reported corvids for testing. From 2015 onward, corvids are tested for WNV if a cluster of mortalities is detected.

**Mosquito Trapping**

The number and geographic coverage of traps operated varied year to year depending on resources and risk assessments based on findings from previous surveillance years. Some traps were operated in more than one location on two different days of the week. Traps were run overnight, and the catches sent in coolers to BCCDC for identification and WNV testing. Mosquito trapping was generally conducted from the first week in June to the last week of October, a shortened interval from the first three years of the program (2003-2005) in which trapping was initiated in May. In 2012 and 2013 the trapping window was focused further, ending in the second week of September. In the final year of the program (2014) mosquito trapping ran from the beginning of July to the end of August and was focused in the Okanagan Valley. Both CDC light traps (Ultra Violet Blacklight) and gravid traps were utilized throughout the program. Most of the light traps were baited with CO2 (from dry ice), which mimics the presence of a host that female mosquitoes will be seeking out in search of a blood meal. 

**Mosquito Identification and Pathogen Testing**

Mosquito submissions were separated into sex and taxonomic groupings: _Aedes_, _Anopheles_, _Coquillettidia_, _Culiseta_, and _Culex_. Mosquitoes were sorted on a chill table to prevent denaturation of any viral RNA and identified to genus or (in the case of Culex) to species. Mosquitoes of the same identity were pooled in groups of up to 50 mosquitoes per pool and tested for WNV by PCR. Beginning in 2006, only female _Culex_ mosquitoes were tested. For large volume traps containing more than 500 mosquitoes, the entire sample was sorted to selectively pick out all the female Culex mosquitoes for PCR testing. Five hundred mosquitoes from large volume traps were initially identified and reported; the remainder (i.e. non-Culex species) was saved for identification at the end of the season. A fraction of the remainder (½, ¼, ⅛, etc.) was identified and the total number for each genus in the trap extrapolated.
